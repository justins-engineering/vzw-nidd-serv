# Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers allow configuration of redirects and
# additional headers for static assets. These are created using special files in
# the top-level static asset directory (the directory containing `index.html`).

# Dioxus does not currently support adding files to this directory so add them
# as separate steps.

# Redirects are specified using the `_redirects` file. See
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/redirects/

# Browsers attempt to prefetch the website icon from `/favicon.ico` - redirect
# this path to the favicon file stored in the `assets` directory.

# Find the hashed name of the icon:
favicon=`ls target/dx/loft/release/web/public/assets/icon-*.ico | head -n 1 | xargs -- basename`
# Create a redirection to send `/favicon.ico` to the web path of the hashed icon:
cat > target/dx/loft/release/web/public/_redirects <<EOF
/favicon.ico /assets/${favicon}
EOF

# Additional headers are specified using the `_headers` file. See
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/headers/

# Files in the `assets` directory include a content-based hash in the name.
# Add a `Cache-Control` header to allow caches to provide these files for up to
# 6 months without revalidating.
cat > target/dx/loft/release/web/public/_headers <<EOF
/assets/*
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=15552000, immutable
EOF

# In `single-page-application` mode any unrecognized path will redirect to
# `index.html` which may confuse some clients.

# Add a valid `/robots.txt` file so crawlers do not try to parse `index.html`
# for crawling permissions. Change this if you want crawlers to index your site.
